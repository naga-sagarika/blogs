   Here is a summary of the story for those who do not know. <br/>
  Once there lived a  demon King named Bhasmasura. Like every other demon king, he wanted to attain the boon of immortality. Bhasmasura meditated on Lord Shiva, for he knew Lord Shiva was very kind and favoring to his desciples.
  As expected, Lord Shiva appeared in front of Bhasmasura and asked what he desired. Bhasmasura, asked for the boon of immortality, and Lord Shiva said he cannot grant that but can grant anything to make him strong. 
 Bhasmasura asked to grant him power to turn anyone into ashes when he places his hand on their head. Lord Shiva accepted the requested and gave him the boon. Immediately Bhasmasura said "How would I know this works? Let me try it on you.". Lord Shiva started
to run to avoid him. Lord Vishnu who was watching all this, came to the rescue of Lord Shiva, by masking himself as a beautiful Maiden , Mohini. Looking at Mohini and her beauty, Bhasmasura, forgot what he was actually doing 
and started to flirt with her. Mohini used this opportunity and asked Bhasmasura to defeat her in a dance duel. During the duel, Mohini made Bhasmasura, place his palm on his head and woosh , he turned into ashes. </p>

    <p>Wow! What a relief! the demon king died. Lord Vishnu saved Lord Shiva.   
  </p>
  <p>What do we have to take away from this? Let us think again. Lord Shiva is the most powerful God. Could he really not stop Bhasmasura? 
    Assuming this story was a fiction,what does this story really want people to learn.

    <li>It is OK to say NO.In most cases it is right to say NO than to face the consequences. Think twice before you give anything. Probably your kids are rolling on the floor crying for a new game to be downloaded,
       or you are a very sweet Manager, and your junior is only try to show he is best only to get the promotion. Promoting a wrong person, the whole team will fall. 
      Downloading a fierce game may make your kids turn voilent. </li>
      <li>Distractions are around us all the time which may makes us feel we are going to gain something. It is important for us to not fall into distractions as we may loose ourselves in the process.</li>
      <li>Taking challenges is good,but do not loose yourself and people around you to win the challenge. Loosing a challenge is better than winning one at times</li>
