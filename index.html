  <h3>Are Dance and Music,Ancient Sign languages to communicate with Sight, hearing and speech impaired?  </h3>

    I am a trained classical dancer and I did a lot of bollywod dance for atleast 15 years. On any day with stress, Dance keeps me calm and relaxed. 
    I have seen a lot of changes in the dance forms and I feel the current dance moves are missing the essence of the art. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The oldest Indian Dance Form is from 2nd century CE and dance performances were usually shown in temples during festivals, though the guru Nataraj(Lord Shiva) is eternal. 
    The main essence of the dance was storytelling. From mythology to recent happenings and sometimes even revolutionary moments where people were encouraged to walk into freedom fights,
    all this were shown through dance and music. Classical dance form shows Navarasas , the nine feelings that are involved with humans everyday and the mudras also depict the various objects and scenarios
    around. The footwoork changes with the emotion associated with the story. </p>

    <p>Temples have always been educational centers for general public, the carvings in most temples also have various mudras and steps of the dance form in carvings. So, I think
    probably dance was an art form like sign language to communicate with all the beings. Background music and the music from payal of the dancer conveyed the message to visually challenged, 
    while the hearing impaired would have benefited from the facial expressions, hand guestures and vibrations from the foot work.

  <p>This is just a thought that crossed my mind when I started seeing my daughter dance. Please do share your comments to this article at <a href="mailto:sagarikasripathi@gmail.com">Naga Sagarika</a></p>
